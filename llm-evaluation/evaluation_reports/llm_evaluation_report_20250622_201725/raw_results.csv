It moderately aligns with Nick's anger by not escalating but doesn't fully address the frustration. Suggestion 2 is less relevant and does not acknowledge the emotional context, making it feel off-topic. Suggestion 3 is empty and thus not useful. The diversity is moderate since suggestion 3 is empty and suggestion 2 is unrelated to the main issue.",anger,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.4,4,2025-06-22T19:33:40.281131

Suggestion 3 is the best as it clearly communicates Nick's frustration while encouraging a boundary (asking before eating), which moves the conversation forward productively. Suggestion 1 is more sarcastic and less helpful, while Suggestion 2 is a mild ultimatum that fits well but is less direct. None of the suggestions significantly de-escalate the tension, so positivity impact scores are moderate to low.
