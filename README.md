Text Sentiment Analysis Chat Application - for DA225o Deep Learning Course at IISc

## Project Overview
> Today's chat applications are built around the same building blocks used when they were emerging -- one-on-one chats, groups, multiple modalities (text, audio, video, emojis, etc.), and any new chat application has pretty much the same functionality.
>
> On the other hand, more and more people are communicating over text than any other form of communication. But text has one problem - the tone (or body) of the conversation is not always apparent, and my require further clarification or eventually lead to misunderstandings while communicating. This happens so often that multiple modalities are then equipped in order to clarify, elaborate or commuicate the same *sentiment*.
>
> We have built an application to enhance our texting experience, and add another dimension to communicating through this medium. We call it **dost-com**, a chat application that does the following:
>
> 1. Understand the ongoing conversation in a text session in real-time
> 2. Provide live analysis on the *sentiment* of the conversation or recent text
> 3. Based on the sentiment understanding and context of the conversation, provide suggestions/prompts to the user to respond appropriately, or tailor it with a baseline
