## Chat 1: Two Friends - Travel Plans Gone Wrong (102 messages)
**Participants:** Sarah and Mike

**Sarah:** Hey! Did you book the flights for our Hawaii trip yet? üòä

**Mike:** Oh no... Sarah, I have some bad news.

**Sarah:** What kind of bad news? You're scaring me.

**Mike:** The flights I was looking at yesterday? They're completely sold out now.

**Sarah:** What?! Are you kidding me right now?

**Mike:** I wish I was kidding. I've been refreshing the page for hours.

**Sarah:** Mike, we've been planning this for MONTHS!

**Mike:** I know, I know... I'm so sorry.

**Sarah:** How could you not book them immediately when you saw them?

**Mike:** I thought I had more time. I was trying to find a better deal and...

**Sarah:** A better deal?! Mike, we had a budget set aside!

**Mike:** I was just trying to save us some money!

**Sarah:** I can't believe this. I already requested time off work.

**Mike:** Maybe you can cancel the time off request?

**Sarah:** Are you serious right now? I told my boss about this trip weeks ago!

**Mike:** I'm sorry, I'm not thinking clearly. I feel terrible.

**Sarah:** I told my family we wouldn't be at cousin Jenny's wedding because of this trip!

**Mike:** Oh god, I forgot about the wedding conflict.

**Sarah:** This was supposed to be our dream vacation, Mike.

**Mike:** It still can be! Just maybe different dates?

**Sarah:** Different dates? I can't just reschedule my entire life again!

**Mike:** What if we look at other airlines?

**Sarah:** I already checked three other airlines while you were typing that.

**Mike:** And?

**Sarah:** All sold out for those dates. It's peak season, remember?

**Mike:** Right... I'm such an idiot.

**Sarah:** I'm just... really disappointed right now.

**Mike:** I know you are. I hate myself for this.

**Sarah:** Don't be dramatic. Just... help me figure out what to do.

**Mike:** What about a different destination?

**Sarah:** Like where? We specifically wanted Hawaii for the beaches.

**Mike:** California? Florida? The Caribbean?

**Sarah:** The Caribbean might be nice... but it's not Hawaii.

**Mike:** I know it's not the same. But maybe it could still be amazing?

**Sarah:** We had that whole itinerary planned. The helicopter tour, the volcano hike...

**Mike:** We could find similar activities elsewhere?

**Sarah:** It's not just about the activities, Mike. It was about Hawaii specifically.

**Mike:** I get that. I really do. I messed up big time.

**Sarah:** Yes, you did. But sitting here being angry isn't fixing anything.

**Mike:** So... Caribbean? Should I start looking?

**Sarah:** I guess. But I'm still upset about this.

**Mike:** I understand. You have every right to be.

**Sarah:** What's our backup budget looking like?

**Mike:** About the same. Maybe a little less since Caribbean can be cheaper.

**Sarah:** Okay, look at Barbados, Jamaica, and maybe the Bahamas.

**Mike:** On it. What about dates?

**Sarah:** Same dates if possible. I'm not changing my time off request again.

**Mike:** Got it. Searching now.

**Sarah:** How did you even let this happen, Mike?

**Mike:** I kept second-guessing myself. Thought maybe prices would drop.

**Sarah:** Prices never drop for Hawaii during peak season!

**Mike:** I know that now. I was being naive.

**Sarah:** We talked about this exact scenario happening!

**Mike:** I know, and I still screwed it up. I'm sorry.

**Sarah:** Sorry doesn't get us to Hawaii.

**Mike:** You're right. But maybe I can make this right somehow.

**Sarah:** How?

**Mike:** I'll cover the extra costs if the Caribbean ends up being more expensive.

**Sarah:** That's... actually really sweet of you.

**Mike:** It's the least I can do after ruining our plans.

**Sarah:** You didn't ruin everything. Just... made it more complicated.

**Mike:** I found some flights to Jamaica! Same dates!

**Sarah:** Really? How much?

**Mike:** About $50 less per person than the Hawaii flights were.

**Sarah:** That's something, I guess. What about hotels?

**Mike:** Looking now. There are some really nice resorts.

**Sarah:** With good reviews?

**Mike:** Yeah, 4.5 stars average. Beach access, pools, activities.

**Sarah:** Send me the links?

**Mike:** Just did. Check your email.

**Sarah:** These actually look pretty nice...

**Mike:** Right? Maybe this could be a blessing in disguise?

**Sarah:** Let's not go that far yet. But it's not terrible.

**Mike:** The snorkeling looks amazing there.

**Sarah:** I did want to try snorkeling. Hawaii or not.

**Mike:** And look at that sunset photo from the resort!

**Sarah:** Okay, that's pretty gorgeous.

**Mike:** So... should I book it? I won't hesitate this time.

**Sarah:** Give me ten minutes to look everything over properly.

**Mike:** Take your time. I'll keep the tabs open and ready.

**Sarah:** I'm still disappointed about Hawaii, you know.

**Mike:** I know. And I'm still sorry. This is all my fault.

**Sarah:** But maybe Jamaica could be good too.

**Mike:** I think it could be amazing. Different, but amazing.

**Sarah:** The food looks incredible in these photos.

**Mike:** Right? I'm getting hungry just looking at it.

**Sarah:** Okay, I've decided. Let's book Jamaica.

**Mike:** Really? You're sure?

**Sarah:** I'm sure. But you're booking it RIGHT NOW.

**Mike:** Already clicking the purchase button!

**Sarah:** Don't you dare hesitate!

**Mike:** Payment processing... and... BOOKED!

**Sarah:** Thank god. Confirmation email?

**Mike:** Just came through. We're officially going to Jamaica!

**Sarah:** I can't believe we're actually doing this.

**Mike:** I know it's not Hawaii, but I have a good feeling about this.

**Sarah:** Me too, actually. Jamaica has always been on my list.

**Mike:** Really? You never mentioned that!

**Sarah:** There are lots of places on my list, Mike.

**Mike:** Fair point. So we're good? You forgive me?

**Sarah:** I'm still a little annoyed, but yeah, we're good.

**Mike:** I promise I'll never do something like this again.

**Sarah:** You better not! My heart can't take this kind of stress.

**Mike:** From now on, I book things immediately.

**Sarah:** Good policy. So what's the first thing you want to do in Jamaica?

**Mike:** Honestly? Relax on the beach with a drink and just decompress from today.

**Sarah:** That sounds perfect. I need to decompress too.

**Mike:** This is going to be an adventure.

**Sarah:** A different adventure than we planned, but an adventure nonetheless.

**Mike:** The best adventures are the unexpected ones, right?

**Sarah:** We'll find out! But I'm actually getting excited now.

**Mike:** Me too! Jamaica, here we come!

**Sarah:** I should probably start researching things to do there.

**Mike:** Already ahead of you. Sending you some links now.

**Sarah:** You're really trying to make up for this, aren't you?

**Mike:** Absolutely. I want this trip to be perfect.

**Sarah:** It will be. Thanks for not giving up when I was mad.

**Mike:** Thanks for not giving up on the trip entirely.

**Sarah:** Never. We both need this vacation.

**Mike:** Agreed. Now let's start planning the perfect Jamaica getaway!

**Sarah:** Deal! üèùÔ∏è

**Participants:** Emma and Alex

**Alex:** Emma, are you sitting down?

**Emma:** Why? You're making me nervous... what's going on?

**Alex:** I have news. Big news.

**Emma:** Good news or bad news? I can't tell from your tone.

**Alex:** Very good news. Life-changing news.

**Emma:** Alex, you're killing me! Just tell me!

**Alex:** I got the job! The one in New York that I interviewed for last week!

**Emma:** ALEX!!! Are you serious?! üòçüéâ

**Alex:** 100% serious! They just called me an hour ago!

**Emma:** I'm literally crying happy tears right now!

**Alex:** You're crying? Don't cry!

**Emma:** These are happy tears! I'm so proud of you!

**Alex:** I still can't believe it happened.

**Emma:** I can! You were perfect for that position!

**Alex:** You really think so?

**Emma:** I KNOW so! You worked so hard for this!

**Alex:** I couldn't have done it without your support.

**Emma:** You absolutely could have, but I'm glad I could help.

**Alex:** You believed in me even when I didn't believe in myself.

**Emma:** That's what love is, isn't it?

**Alex:** Speaking of love... this changes things for us.

**Emma:** How so?

**Alex:** Well, the job is in New York...

**Emma:** Right, and we're in Chicago.

**Alex:** So... does this mean we're moving to New York together? üíï

**Emma:** Is that what you want?

**Alex:** Only if you want to. I know it's a big change.

**Emma:** Are you kidding? Of course I want to!

**Alex:** Really? You're not just saying that?

**Emma:** Alex, I've been dreaming of New York since I was a kid!

**Alex:** I had no idea!

**Emma:** Broadway, the museums, Central Park, the food!

**Alex:** I can't imagine starting this new chapter without you.

**Emma:** You don't have to imagine it because I'm coming with you!

**Alex:** This is going to be amazing!

**Emma:** When do you start?

**Alex:** They want me to start in six weeks.

**Emma:** Six weeks?! That's so soon!

**Alex:** I know, it's crazy fast.

**Emma:** We have so much to do! Apartment hunting, packing, finding me a job...

**Alex:** Are you stressed about finding work there?

**Emma:** A little, but New York has tons of opportunities in my field.

**Alex:** That's true. And my salary will be enough to support us while you job hunt.

**Emma:** I love that you're thinking about us as a team.

**Alex:** We are a team. The best team.

**Emma:** So what's the job like? Tell me everything!

**Alex:** It's a senior marketing position at a tech startup.

**Emma:** That sounds perfect for you!

**Alex:** The company is growing so fast, and they need someone to lead their marketing strategy.

**Emma:** You're going to be amazing at that.

**Alex:** The office is in Brooklyn, which I heard is really cool.

**Emma:** Brooklyn! Even better than Manhattan in some ways.

**Alex:** Really? Why?

**Emma:** More authentic, better food scene, still has that urban energy.

**Alex:** I'm getting more excited by the minute.

**Emma:** What's the salary like? If you don't mind me asking.

**Alex:** It's almost double what I'm making now.

**Emma:** WHAT?! Are you serious?!

**Alex:** Dead serious. I nearly fainted when they told me.

**Emma:** We're going to be able to actually save money!

**Alex:** And travel! Remember how we always said we wanted to see Europe?

**Emma:** This job could make that happen!

**Alex:** Within the next year or two, definitely.

**Emma:** I can't believe this is real life.

**Alex:** Neither can I. It feels like a dream.

**Emma:** When do we need to find an apartment?

**Alex:** Ideally in the next few weeks so I can get settled before starting.

**Emma:** I'm already looking at listings online.

**Alex:** You are? When did you start doing that?

**Emma:** About five minutes ago while we were texting!

**Alex:** I love how efficient you are.

**Emma:** Look at this place in Park Slope! It's gorgeous!

**Alex:** Send me the link!

**Emma:** Just did. One bedroom, hardwood floors, brick walls.

**Alex:** Wow, it's beautiful. And surprisingly affordable!

**Emma:** Right? I thought New York was supposed to be crazy expensive.

**Alex:** Brooklyn is more reasonable than Manhattan.

**Emma:** This is really happening, isn't it?

**Alex:** It's really happening. We're moving to New York!

**Emma:** I need to call my mom and tell her!

**Alex:** I should call my parents too. They're going to be so excited.

**Emma:** What about work? When are you going to tell your boss?

**Alex:** Tomorrow morning. I'm nervous about that conversation.

**Emma:** Why? You're giving them plenty of notice.

**Alex:** True. And it's not like I'm leaving them in a bad spot.

**Emma:** Exactly. They should be happy for you.

**Alex:** I hope so. I really like my team here.

**Emma:** You can stay in touch with them. It's not like you're moving to Mars.

**Alex:** That's true. And maybe they'll want to visit us in New York!

**Emma:** I'm sure they will. Everyone wants to visit New York.

**Alex:** We could host them in our new apartment.

**Emma:** Our new apartment in NEW YORK CITY!

**Alex:** I love how excited you are about this.

**Emma:** How could I not be? This is the adventure of a lifetime!

**Alex:** With the love of my life.

**Emma:** Okay, now I'm crying happy tears again.

**Alex:** I love you so much, Emma.

**Emma:** I love you too, Alex. More than you know.

**Alex:** We're really doing this, aren't we?

**Emma:** We're really doing this! ü•∞

**Alex:** New York, here we come!

**Emma:** I can't wait to start our new life together.

**Alex:** It's going to be perfect.

**Emma:** Even better than perfect. It's going to be ours.

**Alex:** I couldn't ask for a better partner to share this with.

**Emma:** Right back at you. This is just the beginning!

**Alex:** The beginning of everything we've dreamed of.

**Emma:** I'm so proud of you for getting this job.

**Alex:** And I'm so grateful you're willing to take this leap with me.

**Emma:** There's nowhere else I'd rather be than by your side.

**Alex:** Forever and always?

**Emma:** Forever and always. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Chat 3: Parent and Teenager - Coming Home Late (103 messages)
**Participants:** Mom (Jennifer) and Tyler

**Mom:** Tyler, where are you?

**Tyler:** I'm at Jake's house still.

**Mom:** It's almost midnight. You said you'd be home by 10.

**Tyler:** I know, we just lost track of time.

**Mom:** Lost track of time doing what?

**Tyler:** Playing video games. We were in the middle of this really intense match.

**Mom:** This is unacceptable. You know the rules.

**Tyler:** Mom, it's not that big of a deal.

**Mom:** Not a big deal? Tyler, I've been worried sick.

**Tyler:** Why? You know I'm at Jake's.

**Mom:** Knowing where you are and you being where you're supposed to be are two different things.

**Tyler:** I'm fine though. Nothing happened.

**Mom:** That's not the point!

**Tyler:** Then what is the point?

**Mom:** The point is respect and responsibility!

**Tyler:** I'm being responsible. I'm letting you know where I am.

**Mom:** Two hours after you were supposed to be home!

**Tyler:** Okay, okay, I get it. I'm late.

**Mom:** You don't seem to get it at all.

**Tyler:** What don't I get?

**Mom:** Do you have any idea what goes through a parent's mind when their child doesn't come home?

**Tyler:** You worry too much, Mom.

**Mom:** I worry the RIGHT amount! Anything could have happened to you!

**Tyler:** Like what?

**Mom:** Car accident, trouble with friends, getting lost, your phone dying...

**Tyler:** My phone is fine, and Jake's house is like 10 minutes away.

**Mom:** It doesn't matter how close Jake's house is!

**Tyler:** Then what does matter?

**Mom:** What matters is that you said you'd be home by 10 and it's now midnight!

**Tyler:** I said around 10. That's not exactly 10.

**Mom:** "Around 10" does not mean midnight, Tyler!

**Tyler:** I guess I lost track of time more than I thought.

**Mom:** This is about more than time. It's about trust.

**Tyler:** Trust? You don't trust me?

**Mom:** How can I trust you when you don't keep your word?

**Tyler:** I've never done anything really bad!

**Mom:** Missing curfew IS doing something bad!

**Tyler:** It's not like I'm out doing drugs or getting arrested.

**Mom:** That's not the standard we're aiming for here!

**Tyler:** What standard are we aiming for then?

**Mom:** Basic respect and communication!

**Tyler:** I am communicating! I'm texting you right now!

**Mom:** You're texting me two hours late!

**Tyler:** Better late than never?

**Mom:** Don't get smart with me, Tyler.

**Tyler:** I'm not trying to be smart. I'm trying to understand why you're so upset.

**Mom:** Because I love you and I worry about you!

**Tyler:** I know you love me, but the worrying is excessive.

**Mom:** It's not excessive! It's normal parenting!

**Tyler:** All my friends' parents are more chill than you.

**Mom:** I don't care what other parents do. I care about our family rules.

**Tyler:** Our rules are stricter than everyone else's.

**Mom:** Good! Maybe that's why you're a good kid most of the time.

**Tyler:** Most of the time?

**Mom:** Well, you're not being very good right now.

**Tyler:** I'm just talking to you!

**Mom:** You're arguing with me when you should be apologizing.

**Tyler:** Fine. I'm sorry I'm late.

**Mom:** Are you really sorry, or are you just saying that?

**Tyler:** I'm... really sorry?

**Mom:** That doesn't sound very convincing.

**Tyler:** I don't know what you want me to say.

**Mom:** I want you to understand why this is a problem.

**Tyler:** Because I broke curfew?

**Mom:** Because you broke your word to me.

**Tyler:** I didn't mean to break my word.

**Mom:** But you did. And actions have consequences.

**Tyler:** What kind of consequences?

**Mom:** We'll discuss that when you get home.

**Tyler:** Are you going to ground me?

**Mom:** We'll see. Depends on your attitude when you walk through that door.

**Tyler:** My attitude is fine!

**Mom:** Your attitude right now is defensive and disrespectful.

**Tyler:** I'm not being disrespectful!

**Mom:** You're questioning everything I say instead of just accepting responsibility.

**Tyler:** I am accepting responsibility!

**Mom:** No, you're making excuses.

**Tyler:** I'm trying to explain what happened.

**Mom:** I don't need an explanation. I need you to come home.

**Tyler:** Okay, I'm leaving Jake's now.

**Mom:** Good. Drive carefully.

**Tyler:** I always drive carefully.

**Mom:** I know you do. I'm just worried.

**Tyler:** You're always worried.

**Mom:** That's my job as your mom.

**Tyler:** Sometimes I wish you'd worry a little less.

**Mom:** And sometimes I wish you'd be a little more responsible.

**Tyler:** I am responsible!

**Mom:** Responsible people don't miss curfew by two hours.

**Tyler:** It was an accident!

**Mom:** An accident is 15 minutes late, not two hours.

**Tyler:** Okay, it was a big accident.

**Mom:** Tyler, be serious.

**Tyler:** I am being serious! I really didn't mean for this to happen.

**Mom:** I believe that you didn't mean for it to happen.

**Tyler:** So you're not mad anymore?

**Mom:** I'm still disappointed, but I believe you didn't do it on purpose.

**Tyler:** I would never worry you on purpose, Mom.

**Mom:** I know you wouldn't. That's why this is so frustrating.

**Tyler:** I'm really sorry. I'll set an alarm next time.

**Mom:** That's a good idea. And maybe check in with me every hour?

**Tyler:** Every hour? That seems like a lot.

**Mom:** It's better than me wondering where you are.

**Tyler:** Okay, I can do that.

**Mom:** Thank you. That would make me feel better.

**Tyler:** I'm almost home now. Like 5 minutes away.

**Mom:** Good. I'll be waiting up for you.

**Tyler:** You don't have to wait up.

**Mom:** Yes, I do. We need to finish this conversation in person.

**Tyler:** Are you going to yell at me more?

**Mom:** I'm not yelling at you. I'm expressing my concern.

**Tyler:** It feels like yelling through text.

**Mom:** That's because you're feeling guilty.

**Tyler:** Maybe a little.

**Mom:** Good. You should feel a little guilty.

**Tyler:** I do. I feel bad that I worried you.

**Mom:** That's all I wanted to hear.

**Tyler:** I really am sorry, Mom.

**Mom:** I know you are. I love you, even when I'm angry with you.

**Tyler:** Love you too, Mom.

**Mom:** Now get home safe. We'll talk more when you're here.

**Tyler:** Okay. See you in a few minutes.

**Mom:** Drive slow. I've worried enough for one night.

**Tyler:** I will. Promise.

**Mom:** Good. I'll have some hot chocolate ready for you.

**Tyler:** Really? Even though I'm in trouble?

**Mom:** You're not in trouble. You made a mistake. There's a difference.

**Tyler:** Thanks for understanding.

**Mom:** I'm trying to. Just don't let it happen again.

**Tyler:** It won't. I promise.

**Mom:** I'm holding you to that promise.

**Tyler:** I know you will. That's what good moms do.

**Mom:** I try to be a good mom.

**Tyler:** You are a good mom. Even when you worry too much.

**Mom:** I'll try to worry less if you try to be more responsible.

**Tyler:** Deal. I'm pulling into the driveway now.

**Mom:** Perfect. Come inside and let's have that hot chocolate.

**Tyler:** That sounds really good right now.

## Chat 4: Group of College Friends - Exam Results (105 messages)
**Participants:** Jessica, David, Maria, and Sam

**David:** Results are out for organic chemistry! üò∞

**Jessica:** Already?! I thought they weren't coming out until Friday!

**Maria:** I'm not ready for this. I'm literally shaking.

**Sam:** Same here. My stomach is in knots.

**David:** Who's brave enough to check first?

**Jessica:** Not me. This exam felt impossible.

**Maria:** I think I bombed the synthesis problems completely.

**Sam:** Those synthesis problems were brutal.

**David:** I couldn't even finish the last three questions.

**Jessica:** Wait, there were more questions on the back?

**David:** Jessica, please tell me you're joking.

**Jessica:** I'm not joking! I only saw the front page!

**Maria:** Oh no, Jess... there were definitely questions on the back.

**Sam:** Like, a lot of questions on the back.

**Jessica:** I'm going to be sick. I literally missed half the exam.

**David:** Maybe you can talk to Professor Chen about it?

**Jessica:** And say what? "Sorry, I'm an idiot who can't flip a page"?

**Maria:** It's not your fault! The format was confusing!

**Sam:** Yeah, they usually staple the pages together.

**Jessica:** I can't believe this is happening.

**David:** Let's all just check our grades together. On the count of three?

**Maria:** I'm too scared.

**Sam:** Come on, we need to know eventually.

**Jessica:** Fine, but if I failed, I'm dropping out and becoming a barista.

**David:** You're not dropping out. Ready? One...

**Maria:** Wait, I need a minute to mentally prepare.

**Sam:** Maria, you're making this worse for all of us.

**Maria:** I know, I know. I just have a bad feeling about this.

**Jessica:** We all have a bad feeling. That's why we need to just do it.

**David:** Okay, for real this time. One... two... three!

**Sam:** I'm checking... loading... loading...

**Jessica:** Mine's still loading too.

**Maria:** Come on, stupid website!

**David:** Got it! I... I passed! I got a C+!

**Sam:** OH MY GOD I PASSED! I got a B+!!!

**Jessica:** Sam!! That's incredible! üéâ

**David:** Dude, that's amazing! You were so stressed about this class!

**Maria:** I'm so happy for you both!

**Sam:** I literally can't believe it. I thought for sure I was going to have to retake it.

**Jessica:** Your studying finally paid off!

**Sam:** All those late nights in the library were worth it.

**David:** What about you, Jess? What'd you get?

**Jessica:** Still loading... this is torture.

**Maria:** Mine too. The website is probably overloaded.

**Sam:** I'm still in shock. A B+! My parents are going to be so proud.

**David:** You should be proud of yourself!

**Jessica:** Okay, mine loaded! I got... a D+.

**David:** Oh, Jess...

**Sam:** That's still passing though, right?

**Jessica:** Barely. I need a C- to pass. I failed.

**Maria:** I'm so sorry. That's awful.

**Jessica:** I can't believe missing those questions cost me the whole class.

**David:** Can you retake the exam? Or do extra credit?

**Jessica:** I doubt it. Professor Chen doesn't do extra credit.

**Sam:** Maybe you can petition the grade?

**Jessica:** On what grounds? That I can't read instructions properly?

**Maria:** Don't be so hard on yourself.

**Jessica:** How can I not be? This is going to set back my graduation.

**David:** By how much?

**Jessica:** At least a semester. Maybe more.

**Sam:** That really sucks, but it's not the end of the world.

**Jessica:** Easy for you to say with your B+.

**Sam:** I'm sorry, that came out wrong.

**Jessica:** No, you're right. I'm just frustrated with myself.

**Maria:** Speaking of which... I should probably check my grade.

**David:** Did yours finally load?

**Maria:** Yeah, it loaded a minute ago. I just... I can't look.

**Sam:** Want one of us to look for you?

**Maria:** Would you? I can't handle it.

**Jessica:** I'll look. What's your student ID?

**Maria:** No, I need to do this myself. Here goes...

**Maria:** I... I failed. I got a 58.

**Jessica:** Oh Maria... I'm so sorry.

**David:** That really sucks. I'm sorry.

**Sam:** Both of you failed? This is so unfair.

**Maria:** At least Jessica was close. I wasn't even close.

**Jessica:** 58 isn't that far from passing either.

**Maria:** It feels far. And now I can't graduate on time with you guys.

**David:** We'll all still be here to support you.

**Sam:** Absolutely. A semester delay doesn't change our friendship.

**Maria:** You guys are the best, but I'm devastated.

**Jessica:** I know exactly how you feel.

**Maria:** At least you have a chance to retake just the exam.

**Jessica:** Do I though? I've never heard of anyone getting to retake.

**David:** It's worth asking. What's the worst they can say?

**Jessica:** They can say no and make me feel even more stupid.

**Sam:** You're not stupid, Jess. You made one mistake.

**Jessica:** One very costly mistake.

**Maria:** I don't even have an excuse. I just didn't know the material well enough.

**David:** The material was incredibly difficult. Don't beat yourself up.

**Maria:** I studied so hard though. I was in the library every day for two weeks.

**Sam:** Sometimes hard work isn't enough. Sometimes the test is just too hard.

**Maria:** I appreciate you trying to make me feel better.

**Sam:** I'm not just trying to make you feel better. I'm being honest.

**David:** He's right. This class has a reputation for being brutal.

**Jessica:** What's the average grade usually?

**David:** I heard it's around a C-.

**Maria:** So most people barely pass?

**Sam:** That's what I heard too. Which makes my B+ even more surprising.

**Jessica:** You earned that B+. Don't downplay it.

**Sam:** Thanks. I just feel bad celebrating when you guys are struggling.

**Maria:** Don't feel bad! We're genuinely happy for you.

**David:** Yeah, celebrate your success! You worked hard for it.

**Sam:** I'll celebrate later. Right now I want to help you guys figure out next steps.

**Jessica:** What are our options, realistically?

**David:** For you, Jessica, I'd definitely try to meet with the professor.

**Jessica:** And say what exactly?

**David:** Explain what happened with the exam format.

**Jessica:** Think it'll work?

**David:** Worth a shot. Professor Chen seemed pretty reasonable in class.

**Maria:** What about me? I don't have a formatting excuse.

**Sam:** You could retake the class next semester.

**Maria:** That's what I'll have to do. But it means delaying graduation.

**Jessica:** We could both retake it together next semester.

**Maria:** Would you want to do that?

**Jessica:** If I can't get Professor Chen to let me retake the exam, yeah.

**Maria:** That would actually make me feel a lot better.

**David:** See? You guys will get through this together.

**Sam:** And we'll help you study next time.

**Maria:** Next semester, we're having study groups from day one.

**Jessica:** Definitely. No more studying alone.

**David:** I'm in for study groups too. We're all in this together.

**Sam:** Deal. We'll make sure everyone passes next time.

**Maria:** I love you guys. You're making this so much easier.

**Jessica:** We love you too. We're a team.
